# Differential Gene Expression and Correlation Network Analysis of RNA-Seq Data From Upland Chorus Frog (*P. feriarum*) brains 

This repository contains scripts (R and Java) and input data asssociated to the manuscript published in BMC Bioinformatics titled: Neurogenomic Divergence During Speciation by Reinforcement of Mating Behaviors in Chorus Frogs (*Pseudacris*). The manuscript can be accessed using DOI: XXXXX. Java code was contributed by Alan Lemmon and Python code by Oscar Ospina. Code in other langueages contributed by Alan Lemmon and Oscar Ospina.

The scripts and input files were used to detect differentially expressed genes in the brain associated with synaptic trasnmission, as well as overall gene expression patterns. An R script used to generate weighted correlation networks (WGCNA) is included. Code to extract raw counts from BAM files is als provided.
