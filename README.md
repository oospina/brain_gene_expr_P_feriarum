# Differential Gene Expression and Correlation Network Analysis of RNA-SEQ data from Upland Chorus Frog (*P. feriarum*) brains 

This repository contains scripts (R and Java) and input data asssociated to the manuscript published in BMC Bioinformatics titled: Neurogenomic Divergence During Speciation by Reinforcement of Mating Behaviors in Chorus Frogs (*Pseudacris*). The manuscript can be accessed by DOI: XXXXX.

The scripts and input files were used to detect differentially expressed genes in the brain associated with synaptic trasnmission, as well as overal gene rxpression patterns. An R script used to generate weighted correlation networks (WGCNA) is included.

R code was contributed by authors Oscar Ospina and Alan Lemmon. Java code was contributed by Alan Lemon.
